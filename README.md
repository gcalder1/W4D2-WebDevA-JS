# W4D2-WebDevA-JS

## Objectives ðŸŽ¯

* This is a GitHub repo made for the Week 4 Day 2 of Web Dev A - Innovation Fellowship class, where we are continuing our journey with JavaScript.
    * Operators (== , === , !=, %, etc.)
    * Conditional statements (if & switch)
    * Exploring what the differences between template literals vs string concatenation

* This repo will also house the work for the Mad Libs assignment within the index.html & madLibs.js files.
    * The story chosen was the pirate story
    * Added variables within the story for strings, numbers, boolean expressions, and object properties to be changed to change the meaning/ view of the story
    * The boolean expression checks for one word to therefore replace said space with one of the hypotheticals prompted by either "morning" or "evening".
